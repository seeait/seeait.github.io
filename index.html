        <h2>Motivation & Goals</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>SEE-AIT workshop</b> is motivated by the rapid and often chaotic adoption of Generative AI in software-intensive
          organizations and the growing need to bring structure and a human-centric character to this transformation. It positions
          software engineering as the essential backbone for supporting GenAI integration and turning it into a reliable, auditable,
          and maintainable change management process. The workshop recognizes that GenAI introduces unique socio-technical challenges
          —such as non-determinism, trust, safety, and human–machine collaboration—that require a fundamental shift in how software
          engineers and organizations design, build, and govern systems.
          <br><br>
          Our <b>mission</b> is to clarify and strengthen the role of the software engineering community in guiding organizational GenAI
          transformation. It seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners to share and combine concrete practices, methods, and
          frameworks into a concise community statement outlining principles and open questions for organizational GenAI transformation.
          By focusing on organizations rather than purely technical, human, or business perspectives, the workshop aims to help institutions
          internalize GenAI in a way that is sustainable, compliant, and aligned with high-quality software standards.
          <br><br>
          Our <b>goal</b> is to create a collaborative, practice-driven forum that surfaces actionable approaches and open research challenges
          for responsible GenAI integration. Through real-world case studies and cross-disciplinary dialogue, the workshop aims to crystallize
          principles and roadmaps that enable organizations to innovate safely and effectively, while equipping software engineers to evolve
          their roles toward more conceptual, architectural, and abstraction-driven collaboration in the GenAI era.

  <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
  <p>
    SEE-AIT 2026 will be held as a full-day workshop co-located with the FSE'26 in Montreal, Canada, on July 5th, 2026.
    We invite two submission types: <br>
    <li><b>Extended Abstracts</b> (up to 5 pages, including references). Extended Abstracts are suited for concise, early-stage,
      or in-progress work and comply with the FSE’26 requirement for APC-free extended abstracts. </li> <br>
    <li><b>Full Papers</b> (5–8 pages, including references). Full Papers should present well-supported research or practice
      contributions—such as empirical studies, experience reports, design rationales, or evaluation notes—and must offer clear
      context, methodology, and actionable insights for software engineering practice.</li>
